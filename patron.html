                        <p><span class="d-inline-block">Pulikkottil Joseph Mar Dionysius I</span>, the pioneer of Bible Translation into Malayalam language and the founder of Old Seminary, was born on 25th November 1740 as the eldest son of MekkattukuIangara Pulikkottil Chummar (Semavoon) and Cherichi (Elishba) at Kunnamkulam. The good and righteous parents belonged to one of the most traditional Christian Orthodox families in the area. His early name was Ittoop. Even if written accounts are small compared with his merit, monuments still reflect how great our patron was. A child with strange preferences, he was delightfully promising, lovely and godly, showed the early marks of future greatness. The proverb "The growing plant reveals itself in the seedlings" found its verifications in him. Though little is known about his formal education he had profound knowledge in Art, Architecture, Fine arts, and Medicine.</p>
                        <p>While he was serving as Ramban, he identified with himself his real mission by an inner call to found a seminary, a center for learning at Kottayam. The noble idea was haunting his conscience for long. He left for Kottayam met the Eighth Mar Thoma and put forth his proposal before him. His Holiness agreed vocally but kept silent on meeting the expenses.</p>
                        <p>On 22nd March 1815, he was consecrated as 'Joseph Mar Dionysius I' at St Mary's Church, Pazhanji, a small cross church -as mentioned by Buchanan- which was rebuilt as a parish church under his able leadership. The royal declaration of 1816 insisted all Syrian Christians of the Travancore and Cochin accept him as the Metropolitan of Malankara. On 25th November 1816 exactly on the day on which His Beatitude born before 76 Years, finishing his good fight on earth, he departed in peace for receiving his heavenly crown. Let the sacred memory of the devoted life of the late lamented H.B. Pulikkottil Joseph Mar Dionysius I be a source of inspiration to one and all.</p>

                        <p><span class="d-inline-block">Mar Dionasios Joseph II</span> was born on 12 November 1833, in Pulikotil family at Kunnamkulam. In AD 1863, the Church chose him as the Metropolitan of Malankara. In accordance with the decision, Patriarch of Anthioc, Mar Yakub II ordained him as Bishop in 1865.</p>
                        <p> Through out his life he fought against the anti-Orthodox actvities of foriegn missionaries in the name of reformation and in the end he emerged victorious. The present Orthodox church in India owes much to him for protecting the faith of our fathers.</p>
                        <p>With Mor Gregorius Geevarghese Chathuruthy of Parumala and Mor Athanasius Paulos Kadavil of Aluva, Mor Dionysius engaged himself in the task of rejuvenating the church. He brought about much-needed structure to the administration of the Church and started theological seminaries. In 1870, he started a Syriac printing press, Saint Thomas, at Cochin, for publishing Syriac prayer books. At around the same time, he started a Church magazine 'Kerala Pathaka' in Malayalam, which was later merged with another news magazine, 'Paschimathara'. Unfortunately, this Church magazine was discontinued due to financial problems. But again in January 1892, another monthly, 'Edavaka Patrika' started publication from Kottayam Marthoma Press. During his tenure as Malankara Metropolitan, a large gathering of Roman Catholics from Goa joined the Suryani Church. Fr. Alvarez, a member of this group, was later consecrated as Metropolitan Mor Yulios by Mor Dionysius in 1889. Due to the influence of Metropolitan Mor Yulius, another group of Roman Catholics from Ceylon and America too joined the Suryani Church. Their leader Fr. Rene Villate was ordained as Metropolitan Mor Timotheos in 1892.</p>
                        <p>He also started a new Seminary at Kottayam (M.D Seminary) along with an English medium school. He had great care for the coming generations and this made him start new schools throughout Kerala.</p>
                        <p>After serving the Church through turbulent days for more than half a century, Mor Dionysius died at the age of 76 on July 11, 1909, and was entombed at the Old Seminary Church, Kottayam.</p>
