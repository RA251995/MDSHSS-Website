                            <div class="text-justify">
                                <p>Mar Dionasios Joseph II was born on 12 November 1833, in Pulikotil family at Kunnamkulam. In AD 1863, the Church chose him as the Metropolitan of Malankara. In accordance with the decision, Patriarch of Anthioc, Mar Yakub II ordained him as Bishop in 1865.</p>
                                <p> Through out his life he fought against the anti-Orthodox actvities of foriegn missionaries in the name of reformation and in the end he emerged victorious. The present Orthodox church in India owes much to him for protecting the faith of our fathers.</p>
                                <p>With Mor Gregorius Geevarghese Chathuruthy of Parumala and Mor Athanasius Paulos Kadavil of Aluva, Mor Dionysius engaged himself in the task of rejuvenating the church. He brought about much-needed structure to the administration of the Church and started theological seminaries. In 1870, he started a Syriac printing press, Saint Thomas, at Cochin, for publishing Syriac prayer books. At around the same time, he started a Church magazine 'Kerala Pathaka' in Malayalam, which was later merged with another news magazine, 'Paschimathara'. Unfortunately, this Church magazine was discontinued due to financial problems. But again in January 1892, another monthly, 'Edavaka Patrika' started publication from Kottayam Marthoma Press. During his tenure as Malankara Metropolitan, a large gathering of Roman Catholics from Goa joined the Suryani Church. Fr. Alvarez, a member of this group, was later consecrated as Metropolitan Mor Yulios by Mor Dionysius in 1889. Due to the influence of Metropolitan Mor Yulius, another group of Roman Catholics from Ceylon and America too joined the Suryani Church. Their leader Fr. Rene Villate was ordained as Metropolitan Mor Timotheos in 1892.</p>
                                <p>He also started a new Seminary at Kottayam (M.D Seminary) along with an English medium school. He had great care for the coming generations and this made him start new schools throughout Kerala.</p>
                                <p>After serving the Church through turbulent days for more than half a century, Mor Dionysius died at the age of 76 on July 11, 1909, and was entombed at the Old Seminary Church, Kottayam.</p>

                                <p>MDSHSS is very fortunate to have his grace as its first principal. During his tenure,
                                    Sri. Subramanya Iyer (1893-1894),
                                    Sri. P V Philip Kochu Paret (1894-1895),
                                    Sri. Thomas Varughese Kozhi Mannil (1895-1900) and
                                    Sri. G Alexander Master (1900-1901)
                                    served as headmasters of this school. Mar Dionasios Geevarghese was born in Vattaserill family at Mallapally on October 31, 1858. He was ordained deacon by H.H Peter III, the Patriarch of Antioch, on October 12, 1876, and priest by Mar Gregorios Gheevarghese of Parumala on January 18, 1880. He served the church as a Malpan (teacher) at Parumala Seminary and later at Old seminary. In 1903 the church elected him as the successor to the then Metropolitan of Malankara, Mar Dionasios Joseph II. He was consecrated bishop by the Synod of Antioch presided by Patriarch H.H Abdullah at Jerusalem May 31, 1908. Following the death of Mar Dionasios Joseph II in 1908, he became the Metropolitan of Malankara.</p>
                                <p>He effected the Restoration of the office of Catholicos of East which existed in Persia. This was on September 15, 1912. Thus the Malankara Church became truly autocephalous and was able to regain the independence enjoyed by the church in the early centuries. He was the chief architect of the Constitution of Malankara.</p>
                                <p>After fulfilling his mission he returned to heavenly abode on February 23, 1934. He was officially declared a saint by H.H Moran Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews II on February 23, 2003.</p>
                                <p>May his prayers be with us.</p>
