                        <p>MDSHSS is very fortunate to have his grace as its first principal. During his tenure, Sri. Subramanya Iyer (1893-1894), Sri. P V Philip Kochu Paret (1894-1895), Sri. Thomas Varughese Kozhi Mannil (1895-1900) and Sri. G Alexander Master (1900-1901) served as headmasters of this school. Mar Dionasios Geevarghese was born in Vattaserill family at Mallapally on October 31, 1858. He was ordained deacon by H.H Peter III, the Patriarch of Antioch, on October 12, 1876, and priest by Mar Gregorios Gheevarghese of Parumala on January 18, 1880. He served the church as a Malpan (teacher) at Parumala Seminary and later at Old seminary. In 1903 the church elected him as the successor to the then Metropolitan of Malankara, Mar Dionasios Joseph II. He was consecrated bishop by the Synod of Antioch presided by Patriarch H.H Abdullah at Jerusalem May 31, 1908. Following the death of Mar Dionasios Joseph II in 1908, he became the Metropolitan of Malankara.</p>
                        <p>He effected the Restoration of the office of Catholicos of East which existed in Persia. This was on September 15, 1912. Thus the Malankara Church became truly autocephalous and was able to regain the independence enjoyed by the church in the early centuries. He was the chief architect of the Constitution of Malankara.</p>
                        <p>After fulfilling his mission he returned to heavenly abode on February 23, 1934. He was officially declared a saint by H.H Moran Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews II on February 23, 2003.</p>

                        <p>Syro Malankara (Catholic) rites (popularly known as 'Reethu Sabha) was formed from the Jacobite-Orthodox church) by the bishop Mar Ivanios, who was known in the Orthodox church as 'Badhani Methran' in 1930. Majority of its members are from the Jacobite-Orthodox church. Its "Thaksa" is the same as the mother church and the MarThoma church.</p>
                        <p>In 1926 a Jacobite Episcopal Synod held at Parumala empowered Archbishop Mar Ivanios to enter into negotiations with Rome to effect a reunion with the Catholic Church under the expressed condition that the ancient and venerable tradition of the Malankara Church should be kept intact. The Holy Father Pope Pius XI graciously accepted the condition and welcomed the reunion.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly on September 20, 1930, Archbishop Mar Ivanios, Bishop Mar Theophilos Fr. John O. I. C., Bro. Alexander (Fr. Seraphion O. I. C.) and Mr. Chacko Kilileth made their Professional of Faith and were duly received into the fold of the Catholic Church by His Excel. Rt. Rev. Dr. Benziger, Bishop of Quilon, specially deputed by the Holy See. The following day two Rembans, Rt. Rev. Joseph Pulikottil and Rt. Rev. Philipose Cheppad, made their Profession of Faith and were received into the Church.</p>
                        <p>In 1932 His Grace made his visit to Rome and His Holiness invested him with the Sacred Pallium. By the Apostolic Constitution, "Christo Pastorum Principi" (June 11, 1932) the Holy Father benignly established the Syro-Malankara Hierarchy, comprising the Archdiocese of Trivandrum and the Diocese of Thiruvilla.</p>
                        <p>On March 11, 1933, Archbishop Mar Ivanios dedicated his provisional Cathedral to the Mother of God and celebrated the solemn Holy Qurbana in the Cathedral on the following day assisted by Bishop Mar Theophilos and two Rembans. Mar Augustine Kandathil, the Archbishop of Ernakulam, was present on the occasion. The Apostolic Constitution was executed by Rt. Rev. Benziger, the special depute of the Apostolic Delegate.</p>
                        <p>Archbishop Mar Ivanios made the Profession of Faith before the August assembly of the Bishops of the three Rites, priests and laymen, and amidst the acclamations of Oxios (a customary hymn for the occasion). His Grace was enthroned as Hierarchical Head. On July 15, 1953, His Grace Mar Ivanios passed away.</p>

                        <p>We were able to win the 1st place in the Sub District youth Festival for the last three consecutive years with the wholehearted leadership of the Principal. Spiritual guidance has been meted out to younger generations through organizations like MGOCSM.</p>
